## 🍓 **2025-04-02: Solving the workflow setting for the C++ project** 🔧🚀  

### **Issue**  
The following workflow still encounters an error:  

```
The error is caused by missing Visual Studio C++ build components, specifically the Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props file. Your workflow attempts to install Visual Studio Build Tools using Chocolatey but does not correctly configure the environment to use the installed tools.
```

### **Workflow Configuration**  
```yaml

    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:

          git push origin production
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```

## **🔍 Step 1: Verify Your Installed Components**
1. **Open Visual Studio Installer**  
   - Press `Win + S`, search for **Visual Studio Installer**, and open it.  
   - Click **Modify** on **Visual Studio 2022 Community**.  

2. **Ensure the Following Are Installed:**  
   In the **Workloads** tab:  
   ✅ `Desktop development with C++` (if not checked, enable it).  

   In the **Individual Components** tab, **check the following** under “Compilers, build tools, and runtimes”:  
   - ✅ **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools**  
   - ✅ **Windows 10 SDK (latest installed)**  
   - ✅ **Windows 11 SDK (latest installed)**  
   - ✅ **C++ CMake tools for Windows**  
   - ✅ **C++ ATL for v143**  
   - ✅ **C++ MFC for v143**  
   - ✅ **C++ CMake tools for Windows**  

   📌 **Make sure these are installed before proceeding.** Click **Modify** to install missing components.

---

## **🔍 Step 2: Manually Check Installed Files**
1. Open **File Explorer** and go to:
   ```
   C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\
   ```
   You should see `v150`, `v160`, and `v170`, but **not `v170Platforms`**.

2. Check inside the `v170` folder:
   ```
   C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v170\
   ```
   - Do you see `Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props`?  
   - Do you see `BuildCustomizations`?  

   📌 **Let me know what files exist there!**

---

## **🔧 Step 3: Manually Copy Missing Files**
If **`v170Platforms`** is still missing after reinstalling the components:  

### **1️⃣ Copy from an Existing Version**
Check if `v160Platforms` or `v150Platforms` exist:  
```
C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v160Platforms\
C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v150Platforms\
```
If **either exists**, copy the entire folder and rename it to `v170Platforms`.

### **2️⃣ Reinstall VS Build Tools (Last Resort)**
If **you do not have `v150Platforms` or `v160Platforms`**, reinstall VS Build Tools:  
1. **Download Visual Studio Build Tools** from:  
   👉 [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)  
2. **Run the installer**, select **C++ Desktop Development**, and install all required components.  
3. **Restart your computer** and check if `v170Platforms` appears.  

---

## **📢 Final Steps**
After ensuring `v170Platforms` exists, run:
```sh
msbuild /t:clean
msbuild JwwControl.vcxproj
```

## 🍓 2025-03-30: CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Setting Up Self-Hosted Runner for C# WPF Project 🔧🚀  

### **Overview**  
This guide covers implementing **CI/CD** using **GitHub Actions** for a **C# WPF** project. We will:  
✅ Set up a **self-hosted runner**  
✅ Modify **GitHub Actions workflows**  
✅ Create **unit tests**  
✅ Implement **deployment strategies**  

---

### **1. Introduction to CI/CD and GitHub Actions** 🎉  

**CI/CD** is an essential practice that enhances software development efficiency.  
💡 **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically tests each code change to prevent bugs.  
💡 **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Deploys changes to production or a testing environment once tests pass.  

📖 [Read More](#ci-cd-with-github-actions-setting-up-self-hosted-runner-for-c-wpf-project)  

---

### **2. Setting Up a Self-Hosted Runner** 🖥️  

A **self-hosted runner** allows GitHub Actions workflows to execute on your own machine.  

#### **📌 Steps:**  
1️⃣ Navigate to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Actions** → **Runners**  
2️⃣ Click **New self-hosted runner** and follow the installation steps  
3️⃣ Run the setup script and start the runner  

```bash
./config.sh --url https://github.com/your-repo --token YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
./run.sh
```

🚀 Your self-hosted runner is now ready to execute workflows!

---

### **3. GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration** ⚙️  

Create a **workflow YAML** file for building and testing your WPF project.  

📄 **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**  

```yaml
name: Build and Test WPF App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
        with:
          dotnet-version: '8.0.x'

      - name: Restore Dependencies
        run: dotnet restore

      - name: Build Solution
        run: dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore

      - name: Run Tests
        run: dotnet test --no-restore --verbosity normal
```

## 🍓 2025-04-01: GitHub Actions Workflow Automation and Deployment 🚀  

### **Automating the CI/CD Pipeline**  

On day two, we improved the **GitHub Actions workflow** for our **C# WPF project**.  

✅ **Setup .NET 8.0 SDK**  
✅ **Handle dependencies**  
✅ **Build with MSBuild**  
✅ **Run unit tests**  
✅ **Deploy to production**  

---

### **Deploying the Application** 🚀  

Modify the workflow to **automatically publish** the application.  

📄 **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**  

```yaml
name: Deploy WPF App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
        with:
          dotnet-version: '8.0.x'

      - name: Publish Application
        run: dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish

      - name: Deploy to Server
        run: |
          scp -r ./publish user@your-server:/var/www/wpf-app
```

🚀 Your application will **automatically deploy** when changes are pushed to `main`!
