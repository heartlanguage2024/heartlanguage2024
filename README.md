## 🍓 **2025-04-02: Solving the workflow setting for the C++ project** 🔧🚀  

### **Issue**  
The following workflow still encounters an error:  

```
The error is caused by missing Visual Studio C++ build components, specifically the Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props file. Your workflow attempts to install Visual Studio Build Tools using Chocolatey but does not correctly configure the environment to use the installed tools.
```

### **Workflow Configuration**  
```yaml
name: Potato Workflow

    branches:
      - main

## 🍓 2025-03-30: CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Setting Up Self-Hosted Runner for C# WPF Project 🔧🚀  

### **Overview**  
This guide covers implementing **CI/CD** using **GitHub Actions** for a **C# WPF** project. We will:  
✅ Set up a **self-hosted runner**  
✅ Modify **GitHub Actions workflows**  
✅ Create **unit tests**  
✅ Implement **deployment strategies**  

---

### **1. Introduction to CI/CD and GitHub Actions** 🎉  

**CI/CD** is an essential practice that enhances software development efficiency.  
💡 **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically tests each code change to prevent bugs.  
💡 **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Deploys changes to production or a testing environment once tests pass.

---

### **2. Setting Up a Self-Hosted Runner** 🖥️  

A **self-hosted runner** allows GitHub Actions workflows to execute on your own machine.  

#### **📌 Steps:**  
1️⃣ Navigate to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Actions** → **Runners**  
2️⃣ Click **New self-hosted runner** and follow the installation steps  
3️⃣ Run the setup script and start the runner  

```bash
./config.sh --url https://github.com/your-repo --token YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
./run.sh
```

🚀 Your self-hosted runner is now ready to execute workflows!

---

### **3. GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration** ⚙️  

Create a **workflow YAML** file for building and testing your WPF project.  

📄 **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**  

```yaml
name: Build and Test WPF App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
        with:
          dotnet-version: '8.0.x'

      - name: Restore Dependencies
        run: dotnet restore

      - name: Build Solution
        run: dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore

      - name: Run Tests
        run: dotnet test --no-restore --verbosity normal
```

## 🍓 2025-04-01: GitHub Actions Workflow Automation and Deployment 🚀  

### **Automating the CI/CD Pipeline**  

On day two, we improved the **GitHub Actions workflow** for our **C# WPF project**.  

✅ **Setup .NET 8.0 SDK**  
✅ **Handle dependencies**  
✅ **Build with MSBuild**  
✅ **Run unit tests**  
✅ **Deploy to production**  

---

### **Deploying the Application** 🚀  

Modify the workflow to **automatically publish** the application.  

📄 **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**  

```yaml
name: Deploy WPF App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
        with:
          dotnet-version: '8.0.x'

      - name: Publish Application
        run: dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish

      - name: Deploy to Server
        run: |
          scp -r ./publish user@your-server:/var/www/wpf-app
```

🚀 Your application will **automatically deploy** when changes are pushed to `main`!
