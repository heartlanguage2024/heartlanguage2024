# Fixing VCTargetsPath Error in Visual Studio

## Issue Description
If you encounter the following error when building your project in Visual Studio:

```
The imported project "C:\Microsoft\VC\v170\Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props" was not found.
Confirm that the expression in the Import declaration "$(VCTargetsPath)\Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props",
which evaluated to "C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v170\Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props",
is correct, and that the file exists on disk.
```

This typically happens because the `VCTargetsPath` environment variable is incorrectly set or missing a trailing backslash (`\`).

### **Why is `VCTargetsPath` Important in a WPF Project?**  
Even though WPF primarily uses C# and XAML, you might have **C++/CLI (Common Language Infrastructure) components** in your WPF project. This happens if:  
1. **Your WPF project references a C++/CLI project** (e.g., for performance reasons or legacy code).  
2. **You are using a native C++ library with P/Invoke or interop** (e.g., Open CASCADE in your case).  
3. **Your solution includes both C# and C++ projects**, such as a mixed-language setup.

When you build your project, MSBuild relies on `VCTargetsPath` to locate these C++ build definitions. If the path is incorrect or missing, Visual Studio **cannot find the necessary build scripts**, leading to errors like:  
```
The imported project "C:\Microsoft\VC\v170\Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props" was not found.
```

## Solution: Set `VCTargetsPath` Correctly
To fix this issue, ensure that `VCTargetsPath` is set correctly in the system environment variables.

### Steps to Fix:
1. Open **Run** (`Win + R`), type `sysdm.cpl`, and press **Enter**.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab and click on **Environment Variables**.
3. Under **System Variables**, look for `VCTargetsPath`:
   - If it exists, **edit it** and ensure it is set to:
     ```
     C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v170\
     ```
     (Note the trailing `\` at the end.)
   - If it doesn‚Äôt exist, **create a new system variable** with the above value.
4. Click **OK** and restart your computer.

### Additional Steps if the Issue Persists:
- Delete the `.vs`, `bin`, and `obj` folders in your project directory.
- Open Visual Studio and **Rebuild Solution**.
- If the error still occurs, manually edit `JwwControl.vcxproj` and ensure that all references to `VCTargetsPath` are correct.

## Summary
- Ensure `VCTargetsPath` ends with `\`.
- Update the environment variable if necessary.
- Clean and rebuild the project in Visual Studio.

<summary><strong>üçì **2025-04-02: Solving the workflow setting for the C++ project** üîßüöÄ</strong></summary>

### **Issue**  
The following workflow still encounters an error:  

```
The error is caused by missing Visual Studio C++ build components, specifically the Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props file. Your workflow attempts to install Visual Studio Build Tools using Chocolatey but does not correctly configure the environment to use the installed tools.
```

### **Workflow Configuration**

```

## **üîç Step 1: Verify Your Installed Components**
1. **Open Visual Studio Installer**  
   - Press `Win + S`, search for **Visual Studio Installer**, and open it.  
   - Click **Modify** on **Visual Studio 2022 Community**.  

2. **Ensure the Following Are Installed:**  
   In the **Workloads** tab:  
   ‚úÖ `Desktop development with C++` (if not checked, enable it).  

   In the **Individual Components** tab, **check the following** under ‚ÄúCompilers, build tools, and runtimes‚Äù:  
   - ‚úÖ **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools**  
   - ‚úÖ **Windows 10 SDK (latest installed)**  
   - ‚úÖ **Windows 11 SDK (latest installed)**  
   - ‚úÖ **C++ CMake tools for Windows**  
   - ‚úÖ **C++ ATL for v143**  
   - ‚úÖ **C++ MFC for v143**  
   - ‚úÖ **C++ CMake tools for Windows**  

   üìå **Make sure these are installed before proceeding.** Click **Modify** to install missing components.

---

## **üîç Step 2: Manually Check Installed Files**
1. Open **File Explorer** and go to:
   ```
   C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\
   ```
   You should see `v150`, `v160`, and `v170`, but **not `v170Platforms`**.

2. Check inside the `v170` folder:
   ```
   C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v170\
   ```
   - Do you see `Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props`?  
   - Do you see `BuildCustomizations`?  

   üìå **Let me know what files exist there!**

---

## **üîß Step 3: Manually Copy Missing Files**
If **`v170Platforms`** is still missing after reinstalling the components:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Copy from an Existing Version**
Check if `v160Platforms` or `v150Platforms` exist:  
```
C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v160Platforms\
C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v150Platforms\
```
If **either exists**, copy the entire folder and rename it to `v170Platforms`.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Reinstall VS Build Tools (Last Resort)**
If **you do not have `v150Platforms` or `v160Platforms`**, reinstall VS Build Tools:  
1. **Download Visual Studio Build Tools** from:  
   üëâ [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)  
2. **Run the installer**, select **C++ Desktop Development**, and install all required components.  
3. **Restart your computer** and check if `v170Platforms` appears.  

---

## **üì¢ Final Steps**
After ensuring `v170Platforms` exists, run:
```sh
msbuild /t:clean
msbuild JwwControl.vcxproj
```

<summary><strong>üçì 2025-03-28: Automating Service Startup on Windows Boot: Creating `start_services.bat` üöÄ </strong></summary>

## üìå Introduction
Managing multiple services manually every time you start your Windows system can be tedious. This tutorial will guide you through creating a batch script (`start_services.bat`) that automates the startup of **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions Runner**, **ngrok**, and **Git operations**.

By the end of this tutorial, your system will automatically:
- Start Jenkins in the background.
- Ensure GitHub Actions Runner is running.
- Start ngrok and update the workflow with the new public URL.
- Pull the latest code from your Git repository and push any necessary changes.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed and configured:
1. **Java** (for Jenkins)
2. **Jenkins** (`jenkins.war` should be placed in a known directory)
3. **GitHub Actions Runner** (already configured in `C:\Projects\actions-runner`)
4. **ngrok** (installed and accessible via command line)
5. **Git** (configured with SSH or HTTPS authentication)

---

## üìù Creating the `start_services.bat` Script
Create a new file named `start_services.bat` and paste the following script:

```bat
@echo off
echo Starting Jenkins...

:: Start Jenkins in the background
start /B java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8080 --httpListenAddress=0.0.0.0
echo Jenkins started.

:: Wait a few seconds for Jenkins to start
timeout /t 5

:: Check if Actions Runner is running
tasklist | find /i "Runner.Listener.exe" > nul
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    echo GitHub Actions Runner is not running. Starting now...
    cd /d "C:\Projects\actions-runner"
    start /B run.cmd
) else (
    echo GitHub Actions Runner is already running.
)

:: Start ngrok and capture the public URL
echo Starting ngrok...
start /B ngrok http 8080 > nul 2>&1

:: Wait for ngrok to initialize
timeout /t 5

:: Fetch the ngrok URL using PowerShell
for /f "delims=" %%A in ('powershell -Command "(Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:4040/api/tunnels').tunnels[0].public_url"') do set NGROK_URL=%%A

:: Trim the quotation marks from the URL
set NGROK_URL=%NGROK_URL:"=%

echo ngrok URL: %NGROK_URL%

:: Update the ngrok URL in `potato.yml`
powershell -Command "(Get-Content C:\Projects\ConvertImageToBase64\.github\workflows\potato.yml) -replace 'https://.*?\.ngrok-free\.app', '%NGROK_URL%' | Set-Content C:\Projects\ConvertImageToBase64\.github\workflows\potato.yml"

:: Pull the latest changes from origin and merge with local changes
echo Pulling latest changes from origin main...
cd /d C:\Projects\ConvertImageToBase64
git fetch origin
git pull origin main

:: Check if there was an error while pulling (e.g., merge conflicts)
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    echo There was an error while pulling from the remote repository. Please resolve any conflicts and try again.
    pause
    exit /b
)

:: Check if a merge is in progress (MERGE_HEAD exists)
if exist .git\MERGE_HEAD (
    echo Merge is in progress. Committing the merge...
    git commit --no-edit
)

:: Check for uncommitted changes (before merge or after conflict resolution)
git diff --exit-code > nul
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    echo Uncommitted changes detected. Committing changes...
    git add .
    git commit -m "Auto-commit changes"
)

:: Push the merged changes to GitHub
git push origin main

echo All services are running. The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated.
pause
```

---

## üî• Understanding the Script
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what this script does:

### **1. Start Jenkins**
- Runs Jenkins in the background on port 8080.
- Uses `start /B` to keep it running without opening a separate window.

### **2. Ensure GitHub Actions Runner is Running**
- Checks if `Runner.Listener.exe` is running.
- If not, navigates to `C:\Projects\actions-runner` and starts it.

### **3. Start ngrok & Capture Public URL**
- Runs ngrok in the background.
- Waits for initialization and fetches the ngrok public URL.
- Uses PowerShell to parse the JSON response and extract the URL.

### **4. Update GitHub Actions Workflow with the New ngrok URL**
- Updates `potato.yml` in the GitHub repository.
- Uses PowerShell to replace the old ngrok URL with the new one.

### **5. Synchronize with GitHub Repository**
- Pulls the latest changes from `origin/main`.
- Handles merge conflicts if any.
- Commits and pushes changes automatically.

---

## üöÄ Automating the Script Execution on Windows Startup
To make this script run every time Windows starts, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Create a Shortcut**
1. Right-click on `start_services.bat` and select **Create Shortcut**.
2. Rename the shortcut to something like **Start Services**.

### **Step 2: Add to Startup Folder**
1. Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and hit **Enter**.
2. Copy the shortcut into the opened folder.

Now, every time Windows starts, your script will execute automatically! üéâ
